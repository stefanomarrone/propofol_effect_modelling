# Towards a pre-surgery clinical decision support system


This repository contains the replication materials for the paper **"Towards a pre-surgery clinical decision support 
system"**, which investigates the temporal and causal structure of clinical and physiological variables during  
propofol-induced general anesthesia. The work has the objective to create a lightweight model of the heart rate 
under anaesthetic administration. The model is developed according to the Bayesian Network formalism. The analysis 
is based on data provided by the PhysioNet repository
üîó [Propofol Anesthesia Dynamics Dataset (v1.0)](https://physionet.org/content/propofol-anesthesia-dynamics/1.0/), 
consisting of a pre-processing step and a model building phase.

## üìÅ Dataset

This project uses the **Propofol Anesthesia Dynamics** dataset, available on PhysioNet.

### üîΩ Download Instructions

You must manually download the dataset from:

‚û°Ô∏è [https://physionet.org/content/propofol-anesthesia-dynamics/1.0/](https://physionet.org/content/propofol-anesthesia-dynamics/1.0/)

In particular, for a perfect reproduction of the content of the paper, replicate the following lines:

```bash
wget -r -N -c -np https://physionet.org/files/propofol-anesthesia-dynamics/1.0/
mv physionet.org/files/propofol-anesthesia-dynamics/1.0/Data/ ./data
rm -rf physionet.org/
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

To replicate the results, run:

```bash
python run_analysis.py

python run_analysis.py --config configs/default.yaml
