# Replication Package: *Modeling the Dynamics of Propofol Anesthesia*

This repository contains the replication materials for the paper **"Modeling the Dynamics of Propofol Anesthesia with Bayesian Networks"**, which investigates the temporal and causal structure of clinical and physiological variables during propofol-induced general anesthesia.

The analysis is based on data provided by the PhysioNet repository:  
üîó [Propofol Anesthesia Dynamics Dataset (v1.0)](https://physionet.org/content/propofol-anesthesia-dynamics/1.0/)
